# BioQCPy

## Overview

This notebook provides a set of simple quality control analyses for microscopy images, allowing users to flag issues such as saturation, crosstalk or inappropriate bit depth.

**QC checks implemented:**
- Histogram oddities
- Background flatness
- Bit depth assessment
- Dynamic range calculation
- Saturation percentage

⚠️ **WORK IN PROGRESS** The code is based on a prototype script.
